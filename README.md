# Kontrol â€” An Experimental Music Toy

This app is on GitHub as a historical artifact. When iOS 11 is released, this 32-bit app will no longer work or be available on the App Store. It compiles with newer versions of Xcode, but crashes immediately when it's run, and I don't care enough to fix it.
